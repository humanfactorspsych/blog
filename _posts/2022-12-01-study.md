# Topic 1: Reading Narrative Stories and Empathy

### **선정 이유**

서사가 담긴 이야기(narrative stories; narratives)또는 책을 읽는 것과 공감 능력의 관계에 대한 지난 몇 년간의 연구 결과와 향후 연구 방향에 대한 제언이 담긴 리뷰 논문이라 선정함

### **내용 요약**
Open questions and challenges
* What text characteristics drive the social-cognitive potential of narratives?
    * literary fiction to the effect of reading a piece of popular fiction (Kidd & Castano, 2013; 2018; Pino & Mazza, 2016; van Kuijk et al., 2018) => criticism
    * specific narrative style (foregrounding, metaphors, aliterations, ellipses, etc.) 
    * formal narrative characteristics such as the representation of the inner world of protagonists
        * linguistic items that signal high levels of reflection (e.g., “think”, “but”) as opposed to low levels of reflection (e.g., “me”, “can”)
        * empathy for Arab Muslims = higher after reading a full narrative that included dialogues and monologues than after reading a condensed form of the same narrative
    * other forms of texts:
        * biographies, memoirs, and literary journalism (van Krieken, 2019)
* What type of readers is susceptible to these effects?
    * issues: mainly focus on simple demographic characteristics (age, gender), trait empathy, reading amount
        * other individual differences: 
            * openness (Djikic et al., 2013), attachment style (Djikic et al., 2009), low transportability as a moderator between narrative exposure and empathetic concern (Lenhart et al., 2020), adults with specific conditions (e.g., ASD), adults with training (e.g., role-play activities; Bas-Sarmiento et al., 2020), occupation (e.g., Teding van Berkhout & Malouff, 2016; Weisz et al., 2021), verbal and reading abilities (higher print exposure scores find it easier to emotionally engage with story characters (Koopman, 2015; 2016; van Lissa et al., 2018), personal experience with the topic of a narrative => more prosocial behavior/empathetic understanding, depression experience, report more vivid imagery with personal experiences, personal preferences (De Mulder et al., 2021; Djikic et al., 2012; Panero et al., 2016)
* Which aspects of social cognition are influenced by narrative reading?
    * challenges: how specific, quantifiable SC abilities are affected by exposure to the narrative? 
        * other related behaviors: prosocial behavior (Johnson, 2012; Koopman, 2015), emotional contagion, emotion recognition, emotion regulation, social memory, social schemas, facial recognition, or understanding of the self (Mar 2018)
            * high level of affective empathy for the main protagonists => twice as likely to help the experimenter pick up dropped pens
            * reduce prejudice and stereotyping (Hakemulder, 2000; Johnson, 2012, 2013; Johnson et al., 2013a,b; Koopman, 2015; Vezzali et al., 2015; 
* recent approaches using media:
    * popular media (Black & Barnes, 2015a, 2019; Mar et al., 2010; Nathanson et al., 2013)
    * timeline of the effects of narrative exposure (Bal & Veltkamp, 2013)
    * effects of writing rather than reading narratives (Kou et al., 2020; Maciej et al., 2017)

### **의의**
* suggestions for future research:
    * the text characteristics that drive narrative effects of social cognition
    * individual differences approach
    * develop more specific measures beyond empathy and ToM
        * prosocial behavior
